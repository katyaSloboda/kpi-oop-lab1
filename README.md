# kpi-oop-lab1
The purpose of this work: showing the principles of OOP as billiard game. The pool table is built in the console window and you can choose the coordinates of the ball that will be hit and the coordinates of the packet into which it should be hit. The probability that you will score a ball is 1/2. After hitting the pool table in the console is redrawn and again you can choose the new coordinates of the ball.

The program used three classes: Position, Ball and Cue. Class declarations are specified in the space.h file (laboratory condition). The dimensions of the field are controlled by the variables x and y.
